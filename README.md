# App Accelerator Hack Day

## Agenda
### Getting Started - (0.5 hour)
* Intros
* Review the goals and outcomes for the hack day
* Application accelerator technical architecture 
* Walk through sample application accelerator yaml
### Hack Session 1 - Collecting input from developers (2 hours)
#### Collecting User Input (0.5 hour)
* [Set up the local development environment](local-authoring.md)
* Hands-On Lab - [Try out the gallery of input options sample accelerator](https://github.com/dipalpat/app-accelerator-workshop)
#### Facilitated design session to define what custom accelerators to build on the hack day (0.5 hour)
* Output is a written document - a set of collections of accelerators
#### Implement Customer-specific Accelerator from the facilitated design session (1 hour)
### Lunch - (0.5 hour)
### Hack Session 2 - Generate project zip file (2.5 hour)
#### Walkthrough accelerator engine transforms architecture (1 hour)
